ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be?

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

And when we go for a walk in the park
And she holds me and squeezes my hand
We'll go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

ABBA,"Andante, Andante",/a/abba/andante+andante_20002708.html,"Take it easy with me, please
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze
Take your time, make it slow
Andante, Andante
Just let the feeling grow

Make your fingers soft and light
Let your body be the velvet of the night
Touch my soul, you know how
Andante, Andante
Go slowly with me now

I'm your music
(I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song
(I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante, Andante
Oh please don't let me down

There's a shimmer in your eyes
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
Please don't talk, go on, play
Andante, Andante
And let me float away

I'm your music
(I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song
(I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante, Andante
Oh please don't let me down

Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante, Andante
Oh please don't let me down
Andante, Andante
Oh please don't let me down

ABBA,As Good As New,/a/abba/as+good+as+new_20003033.html,"I'll never know why I had to go
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta have you near

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta get you near

I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

ABBA,Bang,/a/abba/bang_20598415.html,"Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
So give it away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love
A boom-a-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing

Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
So give it away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love

And if you're warm and tender
I'll kiss you, return to sender
Please surrender

Bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love
A boom-a-boomerang is love

ABBA,Burning My Bridges,/a/abba/burning+my+bridges_20003011.html,"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad
And I've always been under your heel
Holy christ what a lousy deal
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I ain't gonna take it no more
Oh no no - walkin' out that door

Burning my bridges, cutting my tie
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Being myself
Counting my pride
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges
Moving at last
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past
Gonna have peace now
You can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me

"
ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed

Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on

You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I'm sorry Cassandra
I'm sorry Cassandra
