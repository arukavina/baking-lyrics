A trigram model that generates music lyrics automatically.
Baking Lyrics was developed by a team of music; machine learning and software development enthousiast all the way from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Our country is well know for its rock scene so we were tempted on using a 100% rock corpus but our metal loving friends convinced us of accepting other genres. Oh and there is some cumbia and reggaeton in there as well!

## Baking Lyrics: An automatic lyrics generator

Be a rock star using machine learning to generate lyrics!
Baking lyrics is an automatic generator of lyrics based on a natural language model that is trained using the largest database of lyrics online.
The vast corpus contains all the lyrics of the most popular bands and singers of our time. This corpus was used to train a language model that reproduces the style of each band or singer. If you ever wanted to reproduce the talent of your favorite songwriter, now is the time!

## What is an N-Gram model?

`N-gram models are probabilistic models`

* that assign probabilities on the “next”
* word in a sequence, given the n-1 previous words.
* This algorithm takes in an array of Strings
*(the songs in our corpus), and uses punctuation to select beginning and end tokens on each sentence.
* Baking lyrics uses a trigram model, since it calculates the frecuencies in which every three-word combination appear on each band's corpus, and extrapolates the probabilities from there.
